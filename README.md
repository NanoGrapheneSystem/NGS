# NGS - The Most Powerful Infrastructure for Graphene merchandise and Blockchain Applications

[![Build Status](https://jenkins.eos.io/buildStatus/icon?job=eosio/master)](https://jenkins.eos.io/job/eosio/job/master/)

Welcome to the NGS source code repository!  NGS software enables developers to create and deploy high-performance, horizontally scalable, blockchain infrastructure upon which decentralized applications can be built.

This code is currently beta-quality and under rapid development. That said, there is plenty early experimenters can do. This includes running a private multi-node test network and developing applications (smart contracts).

There is no public testnet running currently.

## Supported Operating Systems
NGS currently supports the following operating systems:  
1. Amazon 2018.03 and higher
2. Centos 7
3. Fedora 25 and higher (Fedora 27 recommended)
4. Mint 18
5. Ubuntu 16.04 (Ubuntu 16.10 recommended)
6. MacOS Darwin 10.12 and higher (MacOS 10.13.x recommended)
