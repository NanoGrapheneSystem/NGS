NGS - The Most Powerful Infrastructure for Graphene merchandise and Blockchain Applications

Build Status

Welcome to the NGS source code repository! NGS software enables developers to create and deploy high-performance, horizontally scalable, blockchain infrastructure upon which decentralized applications can be built.

This code is currently beta-quality and under rapid development. That said, there is plenty early experimenters can do. This includes running a private multi-node test network and developing applications (smart contracts).

There is no public testnet running currently.

Supported Operating Systems

NGS currently supports the following operating systems:

Amazon 2018.03 and higher
Centos 7
Fedora 25 and higher (Fedora 27 recommended)
Mint 18
Ubuntu 16.04 (Ubuntu 16.10 recommended)
